	<b><font size="5" face="Pristina">What an adventure this trip was! I 
	flew to San Jose and then got into Gary's 1948 Bonanza to fly to Redding, 
	California to paint at Burney Falls. We camped at the Burney Falls State 
	Park. The next day, I gathered my paints and hiked down to the falls and set 
	up on the edge of the path headed down to the bottom of the falls. You could 
	hear the roar of the falls at the trail head!</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">Although Burney Falls is not the 
	highest or largest waterfall in the state, it is possibly one of the most 
	beautiful falls. Burney Falls originates from the park's underground springs 
	and flows to Lake Britton, getting larger along the way to the majestic 
	falls. Water from other springs join the falls to create a mist-filled 
	basin.</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font size="5" face="Pristina">&nbsp;The park's landscape was 
	created by volcanic activity as well as erosion from weather and streams.
	<img border="0" src="../ExpeditionPhotos/HatCreek2005/025_25.JPG" width="398" height="531" align="right">This 
	volcanic region is surrounded by mountain peaks and is covered by black 
	volcanic rock, or basalt. Created over a million years ago, the layered, 
	porous basalt retains rainwater and melted snow, which forms a large 
	underground reservoir.</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">Within the park, the water emerges 
	as springs at and above Burney Falls, where it flows at 100 million gallons 
	every day.</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">I was able to paint for hours as 
	the mist of the falls fell across my face. I wanted the viewer to fell like 
	they were right at the bottom of the falls and looking up at the massive 
	roar of water spilling from the falls.</font></b></p>
