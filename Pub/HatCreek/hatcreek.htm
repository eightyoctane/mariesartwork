	known since I was 13, suggested that he could fly me to Hat Creek, California 
	and I could paint while he fly fished.</font></b><font face="Pristina" size="5">&nbsp;

	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">My first journey to Hat Creek was 
	an adventure. After flying from Chattanooga to San Francisco, we 
	got into a small plane and flew 2 hours to Redding, CA. From there we drove to Hat Creek and 
	then

	moving slowly by.</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">WOW - I flew 3,000 miles to be 
	able to stand on the river's edge in Hat Creek. What a chance of a lifetime!</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">At first, I just sat in awe of the 
	peaceful, serene landscape that unfolded before my eyes - so different from 
	the Tennessee.</font></b></p>

	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">The flight and drive to Hat Creek 
	had given me the opportunity to see just how rapidly the terrain changes in 
	Northern California. Mount Shasta with her snow capped peaks and the vast 
	landscape just won my heart. I started getting that old feeling I get when I 
	need to spill what I have in my head and heart on the canvas.</font></b></p>

	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">It was early afternoon when I 
	arrived on the river's edge and got busy setting up. I thought for a while 
	and then decided I would paint my interpretation of the Hat Creek fishing hole. 
	From time to time a fish would slap the water and I could look off in the 
	distance and see the beautiful 
	mountains. The light was changing as the afternoon went by.</font></b></p>

	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">I have made several trips back to 
	this area and have photographed many beautiful areas to paint in my studio. 
	When I remove myself from the location, I am able to put more emotions into 
	my paintings.</font></b></p>
