been an integral part of my life. As a young child growing up in Germany, my 
“Opa” (grandfather) and I would wander the halls of art museums. Even at that 
young age, I was in awe of the great masters and especially moved by the Fauve 
artists – impressionistic rebels of their time. Maybe it is for this reason that 
I consider myself a rebel, a nonconformist. <br>

everything that makes up this environment – all of the sights, sounds and 
smells. After researching the location, I visit the site to make sketches and 
take pictures. Using all that I experience, I paint from the heart, from my 
intuitive self, inspired by color and textures and shaped in nature.</font></span></p>

There is so much sadness in the world that I want my work to be a positive 
influence. If I can make people feel good through the use of color and texture, 
then I have been successful. Come journey with me as I discover the world!</font></span></p>
