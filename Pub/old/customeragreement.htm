<div id="contentHeader">
	<h1 class="pageTitle">Customer Agreement</h1>
	<p><strong>Thanks for choosing OSI. In this Customer Agreement, you'll find 
	important information about your Service, including our ability to make 
	changes to your Service or this agreement's terms, our liability if things 
	don't work as planned and how disputes are resolved. If you're signing up 
	for Service for a minimum contract term, you'll also find information about 
	that contract term and what happens if you cancel a line of Service early or 
	don't pay on time.</strong></p>
	<h4>My Service</h4>
	<p><strong>Your Service terms and conditions are part of this agreement.</strong> 
	Your Plan includes your monthly allowances and features. You can also 
	subscribe to several Optional Services. Together, your Plan and any Optional 
	Services you select are your Service. The terms and conditions for your 
	Service can be found in the brochures that are available when you activate.</p>
	<h4>How Do I Accept This Agreement?</h4>
	You accept this agreement by: 
	<ul>
		<li>Agreeing in writing, by email, over the phone, or in person;</li>
		<li>Opening a package that says you are accepting by opening it; or</li>
		<li>Activating your Service.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you accept, you're representing that you are at least 18 years old 
	and are legally able to accept an agreement. If you're accepting for an 
	organization, you're representing that you are authorized to bind that 
	organization, and where the context requires, &quot;you&quot; means the organization.</p>
	<p><strong>If you don't want to accept, don't do any of these things.</strong> 
	If you do accept, you can cancel a line of Service within 14 days of 
	accepting without having to pay an early termination fee as long as you 
	return any equipment you purchased from us at the time you accepted, but 
	you'll still have to pay for your Service through that date. If you signed 
	up for Prepaid Service, no refunds will be granted after 14 days or if your 
	account has been activated. </p>
	<h4>My Privacy</h4>
	<p>We may collect personal information about you. We may also gather some 
	information through our relationship with you, such as information about the 
	quantity, technical configuration, type, destination and amount of your use 
	of our telecommunications services. You can find out how we use, share and 
	protect the information we collect about you in the OSI Privacy Policy, 
	available at <strong>TBD.</strong> If you subscribe to Service for which 
	usage charges are billed at the end of the billing period (&quot;Postpay 
	Service&quot;), we may investigate your credit history at any time and share 
	credit information about you with credit reporting agencies. If you'd like 
	the name and address of any credit agency that gives us a credit report 
	about you, just ask.</p>
	<p>Many services and applications offered through your device may be 
	provided by third parties. Some of these services and applications, which 
	you may block or restrict at no cost, may involve charges for which you will 
	be billed. The amount and frequency of the charges will be disclosed when 
	you agree to the charges. Before you use, link to or download a service or 
	application provided by a third party, you should review the terms of such 
	service or application and applicable privacy policy. Personal information 
	you submit may be read, collected or used by the service or application 
	provider and/or other users of those forums. OSI is not responsible for any 
	third–party information, content, applications or services you access, 
	download or use. You are responsible for maintaining virus and other 
	Internet security protections when accessing these third–party products or 
	services.</p>
	<h4>What Happens if My Postpay Service Is Canceled Before the End of My 
	Contract Term?</h4>
	<p>If you're signing up for Postpay Service, you're agreeing to subscribe to 
	a line of Service either on a month–to–month basis or for a minimum contract 
	term, as shown on your receipt or order confirmation. (If your Service is 
	suspended without billing, that time doesn't count toward completing your 
	contract term.) Once you've completed your contract term, you'll 
	automatically become a customer on a month–to–month basis for that line of 
	Service. <strong>If you cancel a line of Service, or if we cancel it for 
	good cause, during its contract term, you'll have to pay an early 
	termination fee. Cancellations will become effective on the last day of that 
	month's billing cycle,</strong> and you are responsible for all charges 
	incurred until then. Also, if you bought your wireless device from an 
	authorized agent or third–party vendor, you should check whether they charge 
	a separate termination fee.</p>
	<h4>Can I Have Someone Else Manage My Postpay Account?</h4>
	<p>No problem – just tell us by phone, in person, or in writing. You can 
	appoint someone to manage your Postpay account for a single transaction, or 
	until you tell us otherwise. The person you appoint will be able to make 
	changes to your account, including adding new lines of Service, buying new 
	wireless devices, and extending your contract term. Any changes that person 
	makes will be treated as modifications to this agreement.</p>
	<h4>Can OSI Change This Agreement or My Service?</h4>
	<p>We may change prices or any other term of your Service or this agreement 
	at any time, but we'll provide notice first, including written notice if you 
	have Postpay Service. If you use your Service after the change takes effect, 
	that means you're accepting the change. If you're a Postpay customer and a 
	change to your Plan or this agreement has a material adverse effect on you, 
	you can cancel the line of Service that has been affected within 60 days of 
	receiving the notice with no early termination fee.</p>
	<h4>Government Taxes, Fees and Surcharges</h4>
	<p>You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and 
	local governments. Please note that we may not always be able to notify you 
	in advance of changes to these charges.</p>
	<h4>How Does OSI Calculate My Charges?</h4>
	<p>TBD</p>
	<h4>How and When Can I Dispute Charges?</h4>
	<p>If you're a Postpay customer, you can dispute your bill within 180 days 
	of receiving it, but unless otherwise provided by law , you still have to 
	pay all charges until the dispute is resolved. If you're a Prepaid customer, 
	you can dispute a charge within 180 days of the date the disputed charge was 
	incurred. <strong>YOU MAY CALL US TO DISPUTE CHARGES ON YOUR BILL OR ANY 
	SERVICE(S) FOR WHICH YOU WERE BILLED, BUT IF YOU WISH TO PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT 
	TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION REGARDING SUCH DISPUTE, YOU MUST 
	WRITE TO US AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ADDRESS ON YOUR BILL, SEND AN EMAIL 
	THROUGH THE &quot;CONTACT US&quot; LINK TBD, OR SEND US A COMPLETED MEDIATION REQUEST 
	FORM, WITHIN THE 180–DAY PERIOD MENTIONED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US IN 
	WRITING OF SUCH DISPUTE WITHIN THE 180-DAY PERIOD, YOU WILL HAVE WAIVED YOUR 
	RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE BILL OR SUCH SERVICES(S) AND TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN 
	ANY LEGAL ACTION REGARDING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</strong></p>
	<h4>What Are My Rights for Dropped Calls or Interrupted Service?</h4>
	<p>If you drop a call in your Coverage Area, redial. If it's answered within 
	5 minutes, call us within 90 days if you're a Postpay customer, or within 45 
	days if you're a Prepaid customer, and we'll give you a 1–minute airtime 
	credit. If you're a Postpay customer and you lose Service in your Coverage 
	Area for more than 24 hours in a row and we're at fault, call us within 180 
	days and we'll give you a credit for the time lost. Please be aware that 
	these are your only rights for dropped calls or interrupted Service.</p>
	<h4>About My Payments</h4>
	<p>If you're a Postpay customer and we don't get your payment on time, we 
	will charge you a late fee of up to 1.5 percent per month (18 percent per 
	year) on the unpaid balance, or a flat $5 per month, whichever is greater, 
	if allowed by law in the state of your billing address. (If you choose 
	another company to bill you for our Service [such as another Verizon 
	company], late fees are set by that company or by its tariffs and may be 
	higher than our late fees.) If we use a collection agency to collect from 
	you, we may charge you for any fees the collection agency charges us, if 
	allowed by law in the state of your billing address when we first send your 
	account to a collection agency. We may require a deposit at the time of 
	activation or afterward, or an increased deposit. We'll pay simple interest 
	on any deposit at the rate the law requires. We may apply deposits or 
	payments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account. If your 
	final credit balance is less than $1, we will refund it only if you ask. You 
	may have to pay a fee to activate Service or to reconnect Service if it is 
	interrupted for non-payment or suspended for any reason.</p>
	<p>If you're a Prepaid customer, you may replenish your balance at any time 
	before the expiration date by providing us with another payment. Your 
	balance may not exceed $1,000 and you may be prevented from replenishing if 
	your balance reaches $1,000. We will suspend service when your account 
	reaches the expiration date and any unused balance will be forfeited.</p>
	<p>We may charge you up to $25 for any returned check.</p>
	<h4>What if My Wireless Device Gets Lost or Stolen?</h4>
	<p>We're here to help. It's important that you notify us right away, so we 
	can suspend your Service to keep someone else from using it. If you're a 
	Postpay customer and your wireless device is used after the loss or theft 
	but before you report it, and you want a credit for any charges for that 
	usage, we're happy to review your account activity and any other information 
	you'd like us to consider. Keep in mind that you may be held responsible for 
	the charges if you delayed reporting the loss or theft without good reason, 
	but you don't have to pay any charges you dispute while they are being 
	investigated. If we haven't given you a courtesy suspension of recurring 
	monthly charges during the past year, we'll give you one for 30 days or 
	until you replace or recover your wireless device, whichever comes first.</p>
	<h4>What Are Verizon Wireless' Rights to Limit or End Service or End this 
	Agreement?</h4>
	<p>We can, without notice, limit, suspend or end your Service or any 
	agreement with you for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if 
	you: (a) breach this agreement; (b) resell your Service; (c) use your 
	Service for any illegal purpose, including use that violates trade and 
	economic sanctions and prohibitions promulgated by any U.S. governmental 
	agency; (d) install, deploy or use any regeneration equipment or similar 
	mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, 
	retransmit or regenerate an RF signal without our permission; (e) steal from 
	or lie to us; or, if you're a Postpay customer, (f) pay late more than once 
	in any 12 months; (g) incur charges larger than a required deposit or 
	billing limit, or materially in excess of your monthly access charges (even 
	if we haven't yet billed the charges); (h) provide credit information we 
	can't verify; or (i) are unable to pay us or go bankrupt; or (2) if you, any 
	user of your device or any account manager on your account: (a) threaten, 
	harass, or use vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward our 
	representatives; (b) interfere with our operations; (c) &quot;spam,&quot; or engage in 
	other abusive messaging or calling; (d) modify your device from its 
	manufacturer's specifications; or (e) use your Service in a way that 
	negatively affects our network or other customers. We can also temporarily 
	limit your Service for any operational or governmental reason.</p>
	<h4>Am I Eligible for Special Discounts?</h4>
	<p>If you're a Postpay customer, you may be eligible for a discount if you 
	are and remain affiliated with an organization that has an agreement with 
	us. Unless your discount is through a government employee discount program, 
	we may share certain information about your Service (including your name, 
	your wireless telephone number and your total monthly charges) with your 
	organization from time to time to make sure you're still eligible. We may 
	adjust or remove your discount according to your organization's agreement 
	with us, and remove your discount if your eligibility ends or your contract 
	term expires. In any case, this won't be considered to have a material 
	adverse effect on you.</p>
	<h4>Disclaimer of Warranties</h4>
	<p><strong>We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, 
	including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any implied warranty 
	of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, about your Service, 
	your wireless device, or any applications you access through your wireless 
	device. We do not warrant that your wireless device will work perfectly or 
	will not need occasional upgrades or modifications, or that it will not be 
	negatively affected by network-related modifications, upgrades or similar 
	activity. If you download or use applications, services or software provided 
	by third parties (including voice applications), 911 or E–911, or other 
	calling functionality, may work differently than services offered by us, or 
	may not work at all. Please review all terms and conditions of such 
	third-party products.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Please be aware that if you activated your wireless device 
	through our Open Development program, we can't vouch for the device's call 
	quality or overall functionality.</strong></p>
	<h4>Waivers and Limitations of Liability</h4>
	<p><strong>You and Verizon Wireless both agree to limit claims against each 
	other for damages or other monetary relief to direct damages. This 
	limitation and waiver will apply regardless of the theory of liability. That 
	means neither of us will try to get any indirect, special, consequential, 
	treble or punitive damages from the other. This limitation and waiver also 
	applies if you bring a claim against one of our suppliers, to the extent we 
	would be required to indemnify the supplier for the claim.</strong> You 
	agree we aren't responsible for problems caused by you or others, or by any 
	act of God. You also agree we aren't liable for missed or deleted voice 
	mails or other messages, or for any information (like pictures) that gets 
	lost or deleted if we work on your device. If another wireless carrier is 
	involved in any problem (for example, while you're roaming), you also agree 
	to any limitations of liability in its favor that it imposes.</p>

		<h4>How Do I Resolve Disputes with Verizon Wireless?</h4>
		<p><strong>WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE 
		THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH 
		OF US.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>YOU AND VERIZON WIRELESS BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY 
		BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE'S NO JUDGE OR JURY IN 
		ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN 
		AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS 
		AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF 
		ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE 
		THAT:</strong></p>
		<p>(1) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR 
		SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT RESULTS FROM 
		THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY 
		ADVERTISING FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR 
		MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION 
		(&quot;AAA&quot;) OR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU (&quot;BBB&quot;). YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES 
		YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
		AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR 
		YOU.</p>
		<p>(2) UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON WIRELESS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION 
		WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS. FOR CLAIMS OVER 
		$10,000, THE AAA'S WIRELESS INDUSTRY ARBITRATION (&quot;WIA&quot;) RULES WILL 
		APPLY. WE AGREE THAT IN LARGE/COMPLEX CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A 
		PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF 
		$10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE EITHER THE 
		AAA'S WIA RULES OR THE BBB'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, 
		ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU 
		CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA 
		(WWW.ADR.ORG), THE BBB (WWW.BBB.ORG) OR FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 
		OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU'D LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT 
		BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING 
		IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.</p>
		<p><strong>(3) THIS AGREEMENT DOESN'T ALLOW CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF 
		THE AAA OR BBB PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY 
		OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING 
		RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY 
		THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.</strong></p>
		<p>(4) AS PART OF YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WE 
		PROVIDE YOU WITH A FREE INTERNAL MEDIATION PROGRAM. IN OUR MEDIATION 
		PROGRAM, WE ASSIGN SOMEONE WHO'S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE 
		(THOUGH POSSIBLY FROM OUR COMPANY) TO HELP BOTH SIDES REACH AN 
		AGREEMENT. THAT PERSON HAS ALL THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF A MEDIATOR. 
		NOTHING SAID IN THE MEDIATION CAN BE USED LATER IN AN ARBITRATION OR 
		LAWSUIT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE, PLEASE CONTACT US AT <strong>
		VERIZONWIRELESS.COM</strong> OR THROUGH CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF YOU'D LIKE 
		TO START THE MEDIATION PROCESS, PLEASE GO TO <strong>VERIZONWIRELESS.COM</strong> 
		OR CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR A MEDIATION REQUEST FORM TO FILL OUT, AND 
		MAIL IT TO US AT THE ADDRESS SHOWN ON THE FORM. OR IF YOU'D PREFER TO 
		START THE ARBITRATION PROCESS, PLEASE CONTACT THE AAA OR BBB FOR THE 
		FORMS YOU'LL NEED TO SUBMIT.</p>
		<p>(5) IF YOU OPT FOR THE MEDIATION PROGRAM AND TAKE PART IN AT LEAST 
		ONE MEDIATION SESSION BY PHONE, BUT WE AREN'T ABLE TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE 
		BETWEEN US, WE'LL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA OR BBB CHARGES YOU FOR 
		ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, WE'LL ALSO PAY 
		ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY 
		APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS 
		APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT).</p>
		<p>(6) WE MAY MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE ARBITRATION 
		BEGINS. IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THE OFFER, OR IF WE DON'T MAKE YOU AN OFFER, 
		AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S MORE THAN OUR 
		OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN WE AGREE TO PAY YOU $5000 INSTEAD OF THE 
		AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO AGREE TO PAY ANY ATTORNEYS' FEES 
		AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR YOUR CASE. 
		IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY YOU THAT 
		AMOUNT.</p>
		<p>(7) AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO 
		THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CAN'T BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE 
		THE AWARD ITSELF.</p>
		<p><strong>(8) IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS 
		SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION (3) CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO 
		ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>(9) IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN 
		THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND VERIZON WIRELESS AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT 
		BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZON WIRELESS UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY 
		RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING 
		OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF 
		LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A 
		TRIAL BY THE COURT.</strong></div>
	<h4>About this Agreement</h4>
	<p>If we don't enforce our rights under this agreement in one instance, that 
	doesn't mean we won't or can't enforce those rights in any other instance. 
	You cannot assign this agreement or any of your rights or duties under it 
	without our permission. However, we may assign this agreement or any debt 
	you owe us without notifying you. <strong>If you're a Postpay customer, 
	please note that many notices we send to you will show up as messages on 
	your monthly bill. If you have online billing, those notices will be deemed 
	received by you when your online bill is available for viewing. If you get a 
	paper bill, those notices will be deemed received by you 3 days after we 
	mail the bill to you. If we send other notices to you, they will be 
	considered received immediately if we send them to your wireless device, or 
	to any email or fax number you've given us, or after 3 days if we mail them 
	to your billing address. If you need to send notices to us, please send them 
	to the customer service address on your latest bill.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>If you're a Prepaid customer and we send notices to you, they 
	will be considered received immediately if we send them to your wireless 
	device or to any email or fax number you've given us, or if we post them as 
	a pre-call notification on your Service, or after three days if we mail them 
	to the most current address we have for you. If you need to send notices to 
	us, please send them to the Customer Service Prepaid address at 
	verizonwireless.com/contactus</strong> </p>
	<p><strong>If any part of this agreement, including anything regarding the 
	arbitration process, is ruled invalid, that part may be removed from this 
	agreement.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>This agreement and the documents it incorporates form the entire 
	agreement between us. You can't rely on any other documents, or on what's 
	said by any sales or customer service representatives, and you have no other 
	rights regarding Service or this agreement.</strong> This agreement isn't 
	for the benefit of any third party except our parent companies, affiliates, 
	subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest. Except 
	where we've agreed otherwise elsewhere in this agreement, this agreement and 
	any disputes covered by it are governed by the laws of the state 
	encompassing the area code of your wireless phone number when you accepted 
	this agreement, without regard to the conflicts of laws and rules of that 
	state.</p>
	<p><strong>Additional Disclosures</strong><br>
	We are implementing optimization and transcoding technologies in our network 
	to transmit data files in a more efficient manner to allow available network 
	capacity to benefit the greatest number of users. These techniques include 
	caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing the video more 
	appropriately for the device. The optimization process is agnostic to the 
	content itself and to the website that provides it. While we invest much 
	effort to avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression 
	process and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the 
	optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as 
	displayed on your device. For a further, more detailed explanation of these 
	techniques, please visit www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization</p>
	<p>Verizon Wireless strives to provide customers the best experience when 
	using our network, a shared resource among tens of millions of customers. To 
	help achieve this, if you use an extraordinary amount of data and fall 
	within the top 5% of Verizon Wireless data users we may reduce your data 
	throughput speeds periodically for the remainder of your then current and 
	immediately following billing cycle to ensure high quality network 
	performance for other users at locations and times of peak demand. Our 
	proactive management of the Verizon Wireless network is designed to ensure 
	that the remaining 95% of data customers aren't negatively affected by the 
	inordinate data consumption of just a few users.</p>
