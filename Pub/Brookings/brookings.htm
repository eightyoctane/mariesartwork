	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">I flew into San Jose, got off the 
	plane and headed to Gary's 1948 Bonanza to load it for a trip to Brookings, 
	Oregon. What an adventure trying to get all of my art supplies in his small 
	plane. </font></b> </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">Gary had called ahead and was told 
	the airport in Brookings was &quot;socked in&quot;, meaning fogged in. SO....... we 
	had to fly as close as we could get then rent a car and drive to Brookings, 
	Oregon. This change of plans allowed me to see the Redwood Forest, and as we drove up the coastline 
	I saw just how powerful the Pacific 
	<img border="0" src="Brookings%20sunset%20B&S%20Blue%202.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right">Ocean is 
	with the waves crashing against the rocks. After just experiencing the Gulf 
	in Destin, Florida, the Pacific Ocean was absolutely the most powerful ocean 
	I have experienced. After hiking up 
	to perch on a cliff, I set up my canvas on my easel which took some doing in 
	the wind and mist of the waves breaking. The Pacific was literally 
	surrounding me.</font></b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">I chose a 5 x 6 foot canvas 
	to get the experience of the vast surroundings, standing on a bluff 
	overlooking the ocean all around me. </font></b> </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">
	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">To feel the wind and see the wind 
	moving in the seagrass - it was pure SERENITY that I felt painting up that 
	high over the ocean with a bird's eye view of the beach.</font></b></p>

	<b><font face="Pristina" size="5">I thank my friend, Gary, for giving me the 
	opportunity to fly into these remote areas and experience what beauty nature 
	truly has! </font></b> </p>
