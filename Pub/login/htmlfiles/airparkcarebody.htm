		<td>We all share a very large front yard. The most important question we 
		can all ask&nbsp; is &quot;What can I do to help&quot;?<p>Currently, the most 
		authoritative source of information in this regard comes from Phil and 
		Katie Dater.<p>We have recently added a basic &quot;To Do&quot; list (to your 
		left) - currently this is very basic. There is no authentication, and 
		anyone can update, modify (and trash if you're not careful). When an 
		item is marked complete, it get's placed in the archive, and can later 
		be pulled out of the archive. Use the &quot;search&quot; and &quot;keyword&quot; mechanism 
		to refine your display. When you add new items, &quot;tree&quot; them, and add 
		keywords to make the search more effective. Because there is no 
		authentication, you can bookmark this page and go directly to it without 
		having to first log in to the BMA website.</td>
