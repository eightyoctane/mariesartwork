		into it, I think you will find this application quite sophisticated and 
		capable. Of course the price for this functionality is some level of 
		complication. </font>
		<h5><b>How to use it</b></h5>
		<p><font size="2">We're giving you the highest authority here (which 
		means that if you misuse it, you can screw up the database for 
		everybody). The highest privilege login is admin/passwd which allows you 
		to change anything. I've done this because the database is largely 
		unnpopulated, and I'm wanting you to contribute as much as possible. 
		Please sit down with me (Gary), and get checked out (we can use terms 
		like this at BMA, because people actually understand them!) so you can 
		be effective with the program without messing it up. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2">First step is to login with admin/passwd, and create 
		yourself a lower privilege account (I suggest &quot;edit&quot; level) with your 
		name. It's important to do this because there is &quot;Meal Planner&quot; and 
		&quot;Shopping List&quot; functionality included in the application. You want 
		meals that you plan associated with your login account. It all looks 
		pretty cool but you tell me. You'll still need to log in as admin 
		periodically to add and change fields - you'll see what I mean as you 
		get into it.</font></p>

			<dt><b><font size="2">Recipes</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">Researching this and thinking about it a bit, a 
			recipe can range anywhere from &quot;let's throw it together from 
			memory&quot;, to abstract chemistry. So how can we contribute to this 
			database without making it overwhelmingly complicated? Start simple. 
			If you have a fantastic recipe or idea you want to share with other 
			Blue Mountain residents, get it on here as simply and quickly as 
			possible. You don't have to fill in all the fields - that can happen 
			later - or never, meaning that we all talk frequently, and someone 
			can give you a call if they need more detail. The main thing here I 
			think, is we all need more recipe ideas, so let's help each other 
			out.</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Recipe Rating</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">If you like it, rate it high! However, I would 
			suggest avoiding 0 and 10 ratings unless...</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Restaurants</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">Marie and I were talking in the car one day about 
			La Fayette restaurants and we decided that if we didn't spread it 
			around a bit (meaning only eating at the same restaurant) - it might 
			soon be the only restaurant left in town. The more we share about 
			good La Fayette restaurants - the longer they'll be around.</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Feedback</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">I didn't write this thing, so it's unclear what 
			additional functionality I'll be able to add. But we do need 
			feedback - for example - adding more instructions to this section, 
			and things that will help other residents make use of the 
			application.</font></dd>
