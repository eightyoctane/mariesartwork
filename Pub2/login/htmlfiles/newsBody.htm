		your inputs:<p>Currently BMA registered <b>visitors</b> (not 
		owners/residents) have access to the Projects area of the website only. 
		Soon we will have a BMA &quot;friends&quot; category which will give BMA <b>
		friends</b> access to the airpark wall. </p>
		<p>There are a number of good reasons to have BMA wall privileges. BMA 
		resident/owners monitor the wall more frequently than email, sharing 
		thoughts, fun ideas, and upcoming activities. Because many of us live 
		&quot;in the neighborhood&quot; some of the activities are very last minute 
		(cookout, wine tasting, R/C Helicopter flights, airplane rides). </p>
		<p><b>If you want information fast</b>, having wall privileges is the 
		way to go (like: What are the conditions at the airstrip? Are you really 
		having a pancake breakfast on Saturday? If I get stuck at the airstrip, 
		is there a place for me to stay?) </p>
		<p>Many of those with wall privileges have email notifications set for 
		new wall entries. </p>
		<p>If you want friend and wall privileges, you will need a reference 
		(resident/owner) contact who will vouch for you. Just add this contact 
		info when you register or update your account.</p>
		<p>Other <b>airpark residents and owners around the country</b> can 
		obtain wall privileges by contacting a BMA board member (<a href="mailto:mariesartwork@yahoo.com">mariesartwork@yahoo.com</a>). 
		This is one of our visions for the airpark small-community-website. We 
		would like to see airparks all around the country share these 
		capabilities, and share our collective advantage.</p>
		<p>Give us your thoughts!</td>
