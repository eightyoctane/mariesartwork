				Initiatives can be proposed here. Other members can make

					support will attract leadership. A supported initiative 
				evolves into a committee with a committee leader and members 
				which take action and 
					create milestones toward bringing the initiative to fruition.

					which establish a baseline standard for owner architectural 
				development and property maintenance within the airpark. The 
				Covenants are only a minimal standard and support the spirit, 
				communication, and collaborative approach for new endeavors 
				within our community.&nbsp; At this time, the Covenants are largely 
				managed by the Architectural Committee 
					and regulated by the Board of Directors. </font></p>
