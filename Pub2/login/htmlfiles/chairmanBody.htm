			The Blue Mountain Airpark Vice President role is a unique position. 
			According to the BMA Covenants, the VP is responsible for 
			representing the Board, and also plays the role of Architectural 
			Committee Chairman. What does this mean? The role is significant 
			because the Chairman is the &quot;last word&quot;, and responsible for 
			maintaining a minimum quality building/living standard at BMA 
			according to the Restrictive Covenants. The BMA Restrictive 
			Covenants protect substantial homeowner investments in property and 
			housing within the airpark. Owners involved in new construction are 
			required to submit final building plans and obtain approval from the 
			Architectural Committee before proceeding. Any changes during 
			construction must also be submitted and receive approval. Everything 
			goes smoothly unless there is an undocumented change. It's not easy 
			or desirable to remind owners that these rules are in place. 
			Communication to all, timeliness and fairness to all owners is a 
			critical part of this job.</span></p>
