<p class="MsoNormal"><u><i><b><font size="4">Landing Agreement&nbsp; for Gibson Field (KGE05)/Blue 
Mountain Airpark</font></b></i></u> <font size="1">(v2)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I understand&nbsp; that <b>Gibson Field/Blue 
Mountain Airpark</b> (FAA designator, KGEO5, hereinafter referred to <b>BMA</b>) 
which is located at approximately 34-36-56.0000N / 085-20-35.0000W in Walker 
County, Georgia, <b>is an unimproved grass runway with obstructions, and does 
not meet the standards for public use airports</b>. Furthermore, I 
acknowledge that at any given moment BMA may be rendered unsafe for aircraft 
operations by acts of nature, the intentional or unintentional actions of 
people, or any combination thereof. As pilot-in-command of my aircraft, with 
intention to land or use BMA, I am solely responsible for the safety of my 
passengers, crew, and aircraft. It is my responsibility to use whatever means 
necessary to make necessary preparations and insure safe aircraft operations at 
this airpark.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Registration at the BMA website is prerequisite to landing 
at BMA. My registration at this website is my personal confirmation of knowledge 
and understanding of this landing agreement.&nbsp; I accept all responsibility 
for insuring the safe and uneventful operation of any aircraft I operate at BMA. 
I indemnify and hold harmless all BMA owners and anyone associated with BMA, 
their families, heirs, any personal businesses, employers or employees, from any 
loss, litigation, subrogation, or personal injury that may arise due to my 
actions while at BMA, including my actions while traveling to and from BMA. This 
landing agreement will be kept on file at BMA with my registration information.</p>
