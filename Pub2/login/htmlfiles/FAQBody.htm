		</dl>
		<p><font size="2">For best and quickest results, the 
Construction Proposal &quot;Packet&quot; should include the information outlined in the
		<a href=".http://www.bluemountainairpark.com/BMADocuments/ProjectSuggestionsConstructionAtBMA.pdf">Project 
Suggestions - Construction and Landscaping at Blue Mountain Airpark</a> 
document. The property owner/resident should send a letter or email to the ALCC 
chairman which references the packet as the formal proposal, and should include 
a proposed starting construction date. Upon receipt of the packet, the ALCC has 
30 days to respond with approval, or requested changes required to get approval. 
The email or letter is a critical part of the process and &quot;pulls the trigger&quot; on 
the 30 day response.</font></p><hr>
<p><font size="2"><a name="Board"></a><b>Who officially represents Blue Mountain 
Airpark?</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Blue Mountain Airpark is represented by 
the incorporated and elected Board of Directors who make all final decisions 
regarding the Covenants. Typically the Board delegates the implementation plans 
to a Blue Mountain Committee. The Covenants address the Architectural and 
Landscaping Control Committee (ALCC) specifically. The ALCC collects and reviews 
Property Construction and Landscaping plans using the Covenants, then reports to 
the Board and requests that they either send the Property Owner a letter of 
approval, or itemize the changes which need to be made to bring the Construction 
plan into compliance. Other committees are organized to address and bring 
initiatives to fruition.</font></p><hr>
<p><font size="2"><a name="ALCC Contact"></a><b>How do I contact the ALCC?</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">Marie House is currently the 
chairman of the ALCC. Please email her with any questions at
<a href="mailto:mariesartwork@yahoo.com">mariesartwork@yahoo.com</a> </font></p>
<hr>

<p><font size="2"><a name="How the rules affect me"></a><b>Are there &quot;rules&quot; at 
Blue Mountain, and if so, how do they affect me?</b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2">From a Property Owner 
standpoint, the &quot;rules&quot; at Blue Mountain benefit us all by defining a &quot;minimum&quot; 
living standard within the Airpark (for example, someone cannot build a shack in 
the airpark, store a tractor ourdoors or build a chicken coop next to your 
house). These &quot;rules&quot; are defined in the DECLARATION OF PROTECTIVE AND 
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS FOR &quot;BLUE MOUNTAIN AIR PARK&quot; and were pointed out at the 
time you purchased your property. Every Blue Mountain lot is subject to the 
Covenants.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="Enforcement"></a>Enforcement is addressed 
specifically in Part I item 35 of the Covenants, and involves legal action as 
well as a lien on the subject property. </font></p><hr>
