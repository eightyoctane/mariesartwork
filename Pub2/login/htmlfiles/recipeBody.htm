		<p>START BY JUST LOOKING AT THE RECIPES:</p>
		<p>Click on this link:</p>
		<p>
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluemountainairpark.com/Pub2/login/recipebook/index.php">
		BMA Recipebook</a></p>
		<p>On that screen you'll see a recipe list in alphabetical order</p>
		<p>A good one to view first is under &quot;H&quot;, this is one I just loaded.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>
			<a href="http://www.bluemountainairpark.com/Pub2/login/recipebook/index.php?m=recipes&a=view&recipe_id=65">
			Huevos Rancheros (WW 4 pts)</a></b></li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>You'll see right away that there is a picture. I got this from a 
		Weight Watchers website - </b>it's very easy to add new recipes with 
		photos - cut and paste.</p>
		<p>To do more you have to register, and log in. Experiment, you can plan 
		a week of meals.</p>

			<dd><font size="2">Researching this and thinking about it a bit, a 
			recipe can range anywhere from &quot;let's throw it together from 
			memory&quot;, to abstract chemistry. So how can we contribute to this 
			database without making it overwhelmingly complicated? Start simple. 
			If you have a fantastic recipe or idea you want to share with other 
			Blue Mountain residents, get it on here as simply and quickly as 
			possible. You don't have to fill in all the fields - that can happen 
			later - or never, meaning that we all talk frequently, and someone 
			can give you a call if they need more detail. The main thing here I 
			think, is we all need more recipe ideas, so let's help each other 
			out.</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Recipe Rating</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">If you like it, rate it high! However, I would 
			suggest avoiding 0 and 10 ratings unless...</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Restaurants</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">Marie and I were talking in the car one day about 
			La Fayette restaurants and we decided that if we didn't spread it 
			around a bit (meaning only eating at the same restaurant) - it might 
			soon be the only restaurant left in town. The more we share about 
			good La Fayette restaurants - the longer they'll be around.</font></dd>
			<dt><b><font size="2">Feedback</font></b></dt>
			<dd><font size="2">I didn't write this thing, so it's unclear what 
			additional functionality I'll be able to add. But we do need 
			feedback - for example - adding more instructions to this section, 
			and things that will help other residents make use of the 
			application.</font></dd>
