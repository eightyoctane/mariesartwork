				<td>Currently BMA registered visitors have access to the 
				Projects area of the website. Soon we will have a BMA &quot;friends&quot; 
				category which will give BMA <b>friends</b> access to the 
				airpark wall.
				<p>There are a number of good reasons to have BMA wall 
				privileges. BMA resident/owners monitor the wall more frequently 
				than email, sharing thoughts, fun ideas, and upcoming 
				activities. Because many of us live &quot;in the neighborhood&quot; some 
				of the activities are very last minute (cookout, wine tasting, 
				R/C Helicopter flights, airplane rides). </p>
				<p><b>If you want information fast</b>, having wall privileges 
				is the way to go (like: What are the conditions at the airstrip? 
				Are you really having a pancake breakfast on Saturday? If I get 
				stuck at the airstrip, is there a place for me to stay?) </p>
				<p>Many of those with wall privileges have email notifications 
				set for new wall entries. </p>
				<p>If you want&nbsp; friend and wall privileges, you will need a 
				reference (resident/owner) contact who will vouch for you. Just 
				add this contact info when you register or update your account.</p>
				<p>Other airpark residents and owners can obtain wall privileges 
				by contacting a BMA board member (<a href="mailto:mariesartwork@yahoo.com">mariesartwork@yahoo.com</a>). 
				This is one of our visions for the airpark 
				small-community-website. We would like to see airparks all 
				around the country share these capabilities, and share our 
				collective advantage.</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for this upcoming &quot;friends&quot; feature!</td>
