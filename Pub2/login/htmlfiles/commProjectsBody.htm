			<p>This is a brand new project and information is just coming in. 
			See the Property Owner Home Page &gt; Active Community Projects, for 
			latest info. If you feel you have more up-to-date-info please email 
			to <a href="mailto:mariesartwork@yahoo.com">mariesartwork@yahoo.com</a> 
			and we'll try to get it published ASAP. Some items that are still 
			not clear:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The images that we have from Philip show the water line on 
				the runway side of the road, however, when you actually drive 
				by, the lines are on the other side of the road (which actually 
				seems to make more sense in some respects).</li>
				<li>We have no textual description of the project, so scheduling 
				and impact are not well understood at this point</li>
			</ul>
