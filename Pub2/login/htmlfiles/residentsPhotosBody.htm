				<h4><u><i><font face="Arial" size="4">How to Add Photos (and 
				Albums) to the Gallery</font></i></u></h4>
				<p>We have three different methods of uploading photos to the 
				website, which is the result of some evolution (and it's still 
				evolving). The latest and most granular method is Picasa. </p>
				<p>Latest method!</p>
				<p>We have several photo streams now and we're expanding as I 
				have time to explore further. Currently all is served by Adobe 
				(bad news for Apple Mobile Users), and should be viewable on all 
				PCs, non-mobile Apple products, and non Apple Mobile Devices as 
				well (so there ya go, Apple dislikes Adobe and doesn't play well 
				with their competitive partners, even though, like Microsoft, 
				Adobe is on about 80% of devices worldwide - heh heh my opinions 
				coming out :-) ). </p>
				<p>We're serving photos from Google (an application called 
				&quot;Picasa&quot;). This means that the photos are actually stored out 
				there on the web (&quot;in the cloud&quot;) somewhere, which is really 
				unimportant to us. </p>
				<p>What we're really interested in is how we get our photos off 
				our local computer and uploaded so that people viewing blue 
				mountain can see them. </p>
				<p>We use Picasa by having an account at Google called &quot;<a href="mailto:bmaphotostream@gmail.com">bmaphotostream@gmail.com</a>&quot; 
				with a password of &quot;!Gibsonge05&quot;. Then we download the Picasa 
				Application from the <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa 
				Website</a>. </p>
				<p>We use the Picasa application on our computer to locate our 
				photos, edit them, then upload them to Google. The rest is done 
				behind the scenes, and they will automatically appear at the 
				bluemountain website.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Old method (avoid)</p>
				<p>Go to <a href="http://www.bluemountainairpark.com/dfg">
				http://www.bluemountainairpark.com/dfg</a></p>
				<p>Login as &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;!Gibsonge05&quot;</p>
				<p>Select the residents gallery. Add an album. Go to manage. 
				Starting adding photos. That's it!</p>
