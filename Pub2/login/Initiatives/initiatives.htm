					<h4>Making Proposals at BMA</h4>
					<p>Initiatives are started by BMA owners/residents as ideas 
					and recommendations to solve problems, meet needs, and 
					improve overall lifestyle at Blue Mountain Airpark. 
					Initiatives don't get anything done however. Initiatives are 
					just a mechanism to garner support for a [good] idea. 
					Anyone can create an initiative, but remember, if you 
					create one, your name is attached to it.</p>
					<p><u><b><i>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b></u>Anything 
					associated with initiatives and proposals on the website is 
					informal, final voting must be submitted in writing to the 
					Board of Directors.</p>
					<h4>Initiative Stage</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Open an initiative (this screen)</li>
						<li>Submit at least one proposal (multiples preferred)</li>
						<li>Get the votes you need to get the initiative 
						approved before the voting deadline arrives</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Each initiative is associated with one or more proposals. 
					Later, when votes are cast for an initiative, they are cast 
					with a comment. This gives the voter the opportunity to 
					state which proposal is favored. Votes and comments are 
					public and can be viewed by everyone in the community while 
					the voting phase is in progress. Votes and comments can be 
					changed by each casting voter, at any time during the voting 
					period. </p>
					<p>Be sure to leave enough time for voting. 
					Once the deadline arrives, the initiative will be set to 
					&quot;approved&quot;, &quot;rejected&quot;, or &quot;uncertainq&quot; . The term &quot;uncertainq&quot; 
					just means that we never established a voting quorum (&gt;30% 
					of the possible voters voted), and the initiative closed due 
					to lack of interest.</p>
					<p>If the initiative results in &quot;rejected&quot; or &quot;uncertainq&quot;, 
					it is essentially closed. Once the initiative closes, it must be 
					re-approved by the Board, and reopened by a Board 
					Member. If the initiative is &quot;accepted&quot;, the next phase is 
					the &quot;Committee Phase&quot;.</p>
					<h4>Committee Phase</h4>
					<p>The board president or vice president has the authority 
					to create a new committee and assign a chairman. Once the 
					chairman is assigned, the new chairman manage the committee, 
					and will add committee members with defined 
					responsibilities. </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Present ideas/proposals (face-to-face) to the board 
						and residents formally and informally</li>
						<li>Help build the committee (and lead the committee) and 
						participate on the committee</li>
						<li>Identify the most accepted proposal and 
						start work</li>
						<li>Take responsibility for getting the project done</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Initiatives Page Information (help with this screen)</h4>
					<p>Initiative Name &gt; just an identifier, pick something that 
					is indicative. (Ex: BMA Equipment and Tool Storage Building)</p>
					<p>Short Description &gt; (Ex: We need a storage building to 
					house the BMA lawn mowers and miscellaneous tools)</p>
					<p>Abstract: Your sales pitch</p>
					<p>&quot;I have a proposal ready&quot; &gt; If you check this box you 
					will get another screen after this one that enables you to 
					upload a detailed proposal (this should be a pdf or doc file). It's a 
					great idea to submit a detailed proposal right now, even 
					before the initiative is approved. This will eliminate all 
					questions regarding whether or not you are serious about the 
					initiative. Anybody can submit proposals before the voting 
					deadline.</p>
					<p>Suggested Chairman: If you select this, the person you 
					are volunteering will get an email indicating that you 
					volunteered them.</p>
					<p>Voting Deadline &gt; This is the number of days that the 
					selected group has available to cast a vote and comment on 
					the news page to indicate their support. This doesn't mean 
					it's their responsibility to vote by that time. It's your 
					responsibility to remind (hound) them to make a decision. 
					After the deadline, the Initiative will be set to it's new 
					state. </td>
