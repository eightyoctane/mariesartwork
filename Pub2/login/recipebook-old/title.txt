docs/FAQ.TXT:			PHPRecipeBook FAQ
docs/FAQ.TXT:A. PHPRecipeBook is mainly centered around the ability to manage a weekly menu of meals.  This include the ability to plan the meals, create a shopping list and view and edit the recipe.  If the feature does not go to further these goals then it is not a priority and also may be rejected to avoid feature bloat.
docs/UPGRADE.TXT:If you are upgrading from the 1.x version of PHPRecipeBook there is no direct and easy way to migrate the data. The way that I recommend to migrate to the 2.x schema is to export all of the recipes as PHPRecipeBook XML, then import this data into 2.x.  You will need to be running the last release of 1.x in order to get the most up to date export features.  If everything goes smoothly this should be a very easy and painless proceedure.  Make sure you backup your database and all data files before doing this.  If you run into problems or loose data please post a comment or bug at the sourceForge project webpage:
